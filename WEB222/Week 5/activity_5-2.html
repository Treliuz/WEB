    <p id="quote">I was struggling to lose weight after the birth of my second child. My friend recommended NewYou, and
    </br>
        after the first three months I had lost 30 pounds. Thanks to the personal attention from their trainers and
    </br>
        counselors, I’ve been able to keep the weight off for two years. I’m in the best shape of my life!
