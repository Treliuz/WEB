				<h4>Nature</h4>
				<div>
					Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical universe,
					material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena
					of the physical world, and also to life in general. Manufactured objects
					and human interaction are, in common usage, not considered part of
					nature unless qualified in ways such as "human nature" or "the whole of
					nature". Nature is generally distinguished from the supernatural. It
					ranges in scale from the subatomic to the galactic.
				</div>
				<h4>Earth</h4>
				<div>
					Earth (or, "the earth")the fifth largest planet in the solar system, third in
					order of distance from the Sun. It is the largest of its planetary system's
					terrestrial planets and the only place in the universe known to support
					life.
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large
					polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide
					equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation patterns vary
					widely according to location, ranging from several metres of water per
					year to less than a millimetre. About 70 percent of the surface is covered
					by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands,
					with the vast majority of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.
				</div>
				<h4>Life</h4>
				<div>
					Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life,
					scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is
					characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation,
					response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply
					the characteristic state of organisms.
