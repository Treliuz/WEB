A) From your point of view, identify how the main building blocks of the page is being implemented using HTML (name HTML tags)
	The main builing blocks of the page would be the header with the name of the shop,
	The nav which lets the user jump to different parts of the website
	The footer with copy right information
	The article which will hold the menu items with descriptions and price
B) Also explain if want to implement the page, how do you structure the layout. (how many boxes) 
My layout would contain 8 boxes total
1. For the header
2.For the nav section
3. For the footer
4. The middle part of the page that holds the main menu
5. Box for the entire menu
6,7,8. Would be the 3 columns for the menu item name, description and price
