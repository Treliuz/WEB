    <h1>Web Design Steps</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Determine the Intended Audience</li>
    <p>The colors, images, fonts, and layout should be tailored to the <em>preferences of your audience</em>. The type of site 
        <br>content (reading level, amount of animation, etc.) should be appropriate for your chosen audience.</p>
    <li>Determine the Goals of the Site</li>
    <p>Some common goals of websites are to be informative, to create a personal home page, to establish a
        <br> corporate web presence, and to do business in e-commerce.</p>
    <li>Determine the General Content and Create a Site Map</li>
    <p>The site map is sometimes called a storyboard. Common organizational structures for websites are:
        <br> hierarchical, linear, and random.</p>
    <li>Sketch a Tentative Page Layout</li>
    <p><em>Be consistent in your overall layout</em> — color, typefaces, logo location, navigation bar, etc. Plan your home
        <br> page layout to avoid scrolling. Plan your content page layout to be consistent, with easy navigation.</p>
