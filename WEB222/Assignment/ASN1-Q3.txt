 1) How to create an array with “new Array()” method and instantiate some values to the array?
     You would call a new array object and assign it to a variable and in the parameter list you would enter whatever values you desire
    	let array = new Array("WEB", 222, "NCC");
 2) How to show all the array contents with document.write (without loop)?
    	To show all the array contents you would simply do
    document.write(array);
 3) What does happen when you assign “null” to an array element and display that element (using document.write)?
    	Nothing would appear on the screen when the array tries to print out null un less put between quotation marks
 4) What is the output/main purpose of the following command document.write(arrayName.join(“*”))
    	The main purpose of using join() is to concatenate the array elements together in a single string and seperates each element by an asterix "*"
 5) What is the output/main purpose of the following commands
        document.write(arrayName.lastIndexof(value));
        	This returns the last index at which the given element can be found, if the element is not present it returns -1. 
        	Say value has "apple" stored at index 3 and index 8 it will return '8'.
        document.write(arrayName.indexof(value));
        	This returns the first index at which the given element can be found, if the element is not present it returns -1. 
        	Say value has "apple" stored at index 3 and index 8 it will return '3'.
 6) How to merge two arrays?
    	You can merge arrays by concatenating to them together like so
    let mergedArray = array1.concat(array2);
